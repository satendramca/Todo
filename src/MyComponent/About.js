        The Dowry system is evil in society. It has reduced the sacred affair of
        marriage to a business deal. Brides are treated as a marketable
        commodity. The parents of the brides are often put under inhuman
        pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they become pauper to get their
        daughters married
